I completed a Power BI project as part of a 4-week internship with Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE and Shell, focused on visualizing carbon footprints across sectors. I imported carbon footprint data and created multiple visualizations including a stacked column chart for sector-wise emissions, a line chart, stacked area chart, tree map, matrix, pie chart, donut chart, and table. I also added a slicer to enable dynamic filtering of the data. The dashboard highlights key insights such as the sum of emissions in India and the total emissions across countries, presented through charts and lists. Additionally, I included interactive arrow buttons for smooth navigation between report pages, making the dashboard more user-friendly and interactive.
